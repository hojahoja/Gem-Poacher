# Gem Poacher

A simple game where you move the mouse to collect gems while avoiding hostile
monsters on the screen. The idea is based on Jewel Thief.

## Information about the original version

This game was originally my final submission for the
[Python programming mooc 2023](https://ohjelmointi-23.mooc.fi/osa-14/4-oma-peli).

My idea is to rewrite the game with a more sensible structure, documentation and
testing that will follow the guidelines and standards set by this course. I also
want to develop it further with more features than in the original.
